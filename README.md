# Foodie Friend Finder

Node and Express Servers

### Overview

This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.


### Before You Begin

* Check out [this demo version of the site](https://friend-finder-fsf.herokuapp.com/). Use this as a model for how we expect your assignment look and operate.

### Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!

### Instructions
   * Convert each user's results into a simple array of numbers (ex: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`).
   * With that done, compare the difference between current user's scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the `totalDifference`.
     * Example:
       * User 1: `[5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * User 2: `[3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]`
       * Total Difference: **2 + 1 + 2 =** **_5_**
   * Remember to use the absolute value of the differences. Put another way: no negative solutions! Your app should calculate both `5-3` and `3-5` as `2`, and so on.
   * The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.

7. Once you've found the current user's most compatible friend, display the result as a modal pop-up.
   * The modal should display both the name and picture of the closest match.

### Reminder: Submission on BCS

* Please submit both the deployed Heroku link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
